Gruntfile generator
=============

### Still under heavy development, not usable yet!

A tool for easing the pain when creating initial `package.json` and `Gruntfile.js` files for a project. Not intended as a fully featured generator/editor, just something to get a project started with the most common use cases for the most popular packages.
